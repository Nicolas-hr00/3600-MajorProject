# 3600-MajorProject

- Update 1 - Eric Tsuchiya - 10/18/2022 -
-   All files except Palindrome.c fully implemented.
-   
-   power.c - created by Eric Tsuchiya
-   reverse.c - created by Brandon Tsuchiya
-   replace.c - created by Sahardeed Ahmed
-   Palindrome.c (case sensitive) - created by Nicolas Hidalgo Rotunno - still in work.

- The makefile would work but Palindrome prevents compilation.

- TO RUN WITHOUT Palindrome.c, enter: gcc major1.c power.c reverse.c replace.c -o binops -lm
- ./binops
